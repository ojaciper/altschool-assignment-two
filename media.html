    <h2>Why I Joined AltSchool</h2>
    <p>
        I joined the AltSchool Backend Engineering program to strengthen my expertise in <br>
        backend development, work with scalable systems,<br>
        and gain hands-on experience with modern technologies.<br>
        I wanted to master backend frameworks, databases, APIs, <br>
        cloud infrastructure, and system design in a structured, project-driven environment. <br>
        The mentorship and networking opportunities will  help me bridge the gap between <br>
        theory and industry expectations, preparing me for senior backend roles.
